Feature: Viewing projects
In order to assign tickets to a project
As a user
I want to be able to see a list of available projects
Background:
  Given there are the following users:
    | email             | password |
    | user@ticketee.com | password |
  And I am signed in as them
  And there is a project called "TextMate 2"
  And there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
  And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
Scenario: Listing all projects
  And I am on the homepage
  Then I should not see "Internet Explorer"
  When I follow "TextMate 2"
  Then I should be on the project page for "TextMate 2"
