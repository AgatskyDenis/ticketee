Feature: Viewing tickets
In order to view the tickets for a project
As a user
I want to see them on that project's page
Background:
Given there are the following users:
| email | password |
| user@ticketee.com | password |
And I am signed in as them
Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
| title | description |
| Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my! |
And there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "Internet Explorer" project
And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
| title | description |
| Standards compliance | Isn't a joke. |
And I am on the homepage
  Scenario: Viewing tickets for a given project
    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny!"
    And I should not see "Standards compliance"
    When I follow "Make it shiny!"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny" within "#ticket h2"
    And I should see "Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my!"

    When I follow "Ticketee"
    And I follow "Internet Explorer"
    Then I should see "Standards compliance"
    And I should not see "Make it shiny!"
    When I follow "Standards compliance"
    Then I should see "Standards compliance" within "#ticket h2"
    And I should see "Isn't a joke."
