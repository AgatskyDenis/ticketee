Feature: Viewing tickets
In order to view the tickets for a project
As a user
I want to see them on that project's page
Background:
  Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
  And that project has a ticket:
    | title          | description                   |
    | Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my! |
  And there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
  And that project has a ticket:
    | title                | description   |
    | Standards compliance | Isn't a joke. |
  And I am on the homepage
  Scenario: Viewing tickets for a given project
    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny!"
    And I should not see "Standards compliance"
    When I follow "Make it shiny!"
    Then I should see "Make it shiny" within "#ticket h2"
    And I should see "Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my!"

    When I follow "Ticketee"
    And I follow "Internet Explorer"
    Then I should see "Standards compliance"
    And I should not see "Make it shiny!"
    When I follow "Standards compliance"
    Then I should see "Standards compliance" within "#ticket h2"
    And I should see "Isn't a joke."
