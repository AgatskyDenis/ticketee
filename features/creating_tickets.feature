Feature: Creating Tickets
  In order to create tickets for projects
  As a user
  I want to be able to select a project and do that

  Background:
    Given there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
    And there are the following users:
      | email             | password |
      | user@ticketee.com | password |
    And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "Internet Explorer" project\
    And "user@ticketee.com" can create tickets in the "Internet Explorer" project
    And I am signed in as them
    And I am on the homepage
    When I follow "Internet Explorer"
    And I follow "New Ticket"

  Scenario: Creating a ticket 
    When I fill in "Title" with "Non-standards compliance"
    And I fill in "Description" with "My pages are ugly!"
    And I press "Create Ticket"
    Then I should see "Ticket has been created."
    Then I should see "Created by user@ticketee.com"

  Scenario: Creating a ticket without valid attributes fails
    When I press "Create Ticket"
    Then I should see "Ticket has not been created."
    And I should see "Title can't be blank"
    And I should see "Description can't be blank"

  Scenario: Description must be longer than 10 characters
    When I fill in "Title" with "Non-standards compliance"
    And I fill in "Description" with "it sucks"
    And I press "Create Ticket"
    Then I should see "Ticket has not been created."
    And I should see "Description is too short"

Scenario: Creating a ticket with an attachment
  When I fill in "Title" with "Add documentation for blink tag"
  And I fill in "Description" with "The blink tag has an undocumented speed attribute"
  And I attach the file "spec/fixtures/speed.txt" to "File #1"
  And I attach the file "spec/fixtures/spin.txt" to "File #2"
  And I attach the file "spec/fixtures/gradient.txt" to "File #3"
  And I press "Create Ticket"
  Then I should see "Ticket has been created."
  And I should see "speed.txt" within "#ticket .assets"
  And I should see "spin.txt" within "#ticket .assets"
  And I should see "gradient.txt" within "#ticket .assets"
