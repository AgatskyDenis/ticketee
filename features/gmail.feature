Feature: Gmail
  In order to send real world emails
  As the application
  I want to ensure my configuration is correct

  Background:
    Given there are the following users:
      | email              | password   |
      | alice@ticketee.com | password   |
      | agatsky.dn@gmail.com | Yourriver |
      
    And Action Mailer delivers via SMTP
    Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
    And "alice@ticketee.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
    And "agatsky.dn@gmail.com" can view the "TextMate 2" project
    And "agatsky.dn@gmail.com" has created a ticket for this project:
      | title        | description       |
      | Release date | TBA very shortly. |
      
  Scenario: Receiving a real-world email
    Given I am signed in as "alice@ticketee.com"
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I follow "TextMate 2"
    And I follow "Release date"
    And I fill in "Text" with "Posting a comment!"
    And I press "Create Comment"
    Then I should see "Comment has been created."

    When I log into gmail with:
      | username           | password   |
      | agatsky.dn@gmail.com | Yourriver |
    Then there should be an email from Ticketee in my inbox
