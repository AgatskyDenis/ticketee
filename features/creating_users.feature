Feature: Creating Users
In order to add new users to the system
As an admin
I want to be able to add them through the backend
Background:
 Given there are the following users:
   | email              | password | admin |
   | admin@ticketee.com | password | true |
  And I am signed in as them
  Given I am on the homepage
  When I follow "Admin"
  And I follow "Users"
  When I follow "New User"
Scenario: Creating a new user
  And I fill in "Email" with "newbie@ticketee.com"
  And I fill in "Password" with "password"
  And I press "Create User"
  Then I should see "User has been created."
Scenario: Leaving email blank results in an error
 When I fill in "Email" with ""
 And I fill in "Password" with "password"
 And I press "Create User"
 Then I should see "User has not been created."
 And I should see "Email can't be blank"
