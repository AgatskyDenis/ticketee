Feature: Editing tickets
  In order to alter ticket information
  As a user
  I want a form to edit the tickets
Background:
  Given there are the following users:
    | email             | password |
    | user@ticketee.com | password |
  And I am signed in as them
  Given there is a project called "TextMate 2"
  And "user@ticketee.com" has created a ticket for this project:
    | title          | description                   |
    | Make it shiny! | Gradients! Starbursts! Oh my! |
  Given I am on the homepage
  When I follow "TextMate 2"
  And I follow "Make it shiny!"
  When I follow "Edit Ticket"
Scenario: Updating a ticket
  When I fill in "Title" with "Make it really shiny!"
  And I press "Update Ticket"
  Then I should see "Ticket has been updated."
  And I should see "Make it really shiny!" within "#ticket h2"
  But I should not see "Make it shiny!"
Scenario: Updating a ticket with invalid information
  When I fill in "Title" with ""
  And I press "Update Ticket"
  Then I should see "Ticket has not been updated."
